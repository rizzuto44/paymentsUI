## üåê **2. Backend API for Username Search**

### Q2.1: Do you have a backend API ready for username resolution?
If yes, what's the endpoint? If no, should I mock it for now?
**Answer:** 

I dont. We likely need to set up supabase for this and do all of this work.

### Q2.2: What's the expected API response format?
Example:
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "username": "jacob",
      "ownerAddress": "0x123...",
      "preferredDstEid": 10247,
      "chainKey": "base"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Answer:** 

No idea. Need your help here.

### Q2.3: Any authentication required for the username API?
(API keys, CORS settings, etc.)

For this demo, not necessary.

## üìÑ **3. MYOFT Contract Integration**

### Q3.1: How should I load contract addresses?
- A) Dynamically from `deployments/` folder
- B) Hardcoded in config files  
- C) Environment variables
**Answer:** 

Good question, I dont imagine theyll change for this demo so do whatever is easiest.

### Q3.2: Should the frontend auto-detect optimal network?
(Based on gas fees, liquidity, etc., or let user choose?)
**Answer:** 

No. 

### Q3.3: Cross-chain transfer error handling?
Any specific error messages or recovery flows for LayerZero failures?
**Answer:** 

No. When we call the LZ functions we already need to provide a return address in the event of errors so its fine.

### Q3.4: Token decimals and display format?
How should amounts be formatted? (e.g., "1.50 USDT" vs "1.500000 USDT")
**Answer:** 

The UI should have dynamic number handling where, if I type 100..nothing happens, but as soon as i add a fourth 0, it goes from 100 to 1,000. In terms of decimals, dont show them unless the user types it in.

## üö® **6. Error Handling & User Experience**

### Q6.1: Error message detail level?
- A) Technical details for debugging
- B) User-friendly simplified messages
- C) Both (technical in console, friendly to user)
**Answer:** 

I don't really care about error handling for this demo. All I care about is that we sync back the status of a "payment" so the user can see their payment to xyz person was successful. We can do this by reading the blockchain in question and also by reading data from LayerZero Scan. I can figure out how to get you the Scan API later.

Console is fine.

Just show errors.

Return errors on FE.

Write tests as you go. We want to test each componnent one by one.

### Q7.2: Testing framework preferences?
Any specific preferences beyond standard Next.js testing tools?
**Answer:** 

No.

### Q7.3: E2E testing scope?
Should I include Playwright tests, or focus on unit/integration testing?

Whatever you recommend. I mainly just want to test the core functionality.

## üéØ **12. Success Criteria**

### Q12.1: Definition of "done"?
